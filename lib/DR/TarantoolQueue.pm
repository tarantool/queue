=head1 NAME

DR::TarantoolQueue - client for tarantool's queue


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $queue = DR::TarantoolQueue->new(
        host    => 'tarantool.host',
        port    => 33014,
        tube    => 'request_queue',
        space   => 11,

        connect_opts => {   # see perldoc DR::Tarantool
            reconnect_period    => 1,
            reconnect_always    => 1
        }
    );


    # put empty task into queue with name 'request_queue'
    my $task = $queue->put;

    my $task = $queue->put(data => [ 1, 2, 3 ]);

    printf "task.id = %s\n", $task->id;

=head2 DESCRIPTION

The module contains sync and async (coro) driver for tarantool queue.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 host (ro) & port (ro)

Tarantool's parameters.

=head2 connect_opts (ro)

Additional options for L<DR::Tarantool>. HashRef.

=head2 coro (ro)

If B<true> (default) the driver will use L<Coro> tarantool's driver,
otherwise the driver will use sync driver.

=head2 ttl (rw)

Default B<ttl> for tasks.

=head2 ttr (rw)

Default B<ttr> for tasks.

=head2 pri (rw)

Default B<pri> for tasks.

=head2 delay (rw)

Default B<delay> for tasks.

=head2 space (rw)

Default B<space> for tasks.

=head2 tube (rw)

Default B<tube> for tasks.


=head2 defaults

Defaults for queues. B<HashRef>. Key is tube name. Value is a hash with
the following fields:

=over

=item ttl

=item ttr

=item delay

=item pri

=back

Methods L</put> (L</urgent>) use these parameters if they
are absent (otherwise it uses the same global attributes).

=head1 Producer methods

=head2 put

    $q->put;
    $q->put(data => { 1 => 2 });
    $q->put(space => 1, tube => 'abc',
            delay => 10, ttl => 3600,
            ttr => 60, pri => 10, data => [ 3, 4, 5 ]);
    $q->put(data => 'string');


Enqueue a task. Returns new L<task|DR::TarantoolQueue::Task> object.
The list of fields with task data (C<< data => ... >>) is optional.


If 'B<space>' and (or) 'B<tube>' aren't defined the method
will try to use them from L<queue|DR::TarantoolQueue/new> object.

=cut

sub put {
    my ($self, %opts) = @_;

}

=head2 put_unique

    $q->put_unique(space => 1, tube => 'abc',
            delay => 10, ttl => 3600,
            ttr => 60, pri => 10, data => [ 3, 4, 5 ]);
    $q->put_unique(data => 'string');


Enqueue an unique task. Returns new L<task|DR::TarantoolQueue::Task> object,
if it was not enqueued previously. Otherwise it will return existing task. 
The list of fields with task data (C<< data => ... >>) is optional.


If 'B<space>' and (or) 'B<tube>' aren't defined the method
will try to use them from L<queue|DR::TarantoolQueue/new> object.

=cut

sub put_unique {
    my ($self, %opts) = @_;
    return $self->_producer(put_unique => \%opts);
}

=head2 urgent

Enqueue a task. The task will get the highest priority.
If delay is not zero, the function is equivalent to
L<put|DR::TarantoolQueue/put>.

=cut

sub urgent {
    my ($self, %opts) = @_;
    return $self->_producer(urgent => \%opts);
}


=head1 Consumer methods

=head2 take

    my $task = $q->take;
    my $task = $q->take(timeout => 0.5);
    my $task = $q->take(space => 1, tube => 'requests, timeout => 20);

If there are tasks in the queue ready for execution,
take the highest-priority task. Otherwise, wait for
a ready task to appear in the queue, and, as soon as
it appears, mark it as taken and return to the consumer.
If there is a timeout, and the task doesn't appear until
the timeout expires, returns B<undef>. If timeout is not
given, waits indefinitely.

All the time while the consumer is working on a task,
it must keep the connection to the server open. If a
connection disappears while the consumer is still
working on a task, the task is put back on the ready list.

=cut

sub take {
    my ($self, %o) = @_;
    _check_opts \%o, qw(space tube timeout);
    $o{space} = $self->space unless defined $o{space};

        ]
    );

=head2 ack

    $q->ack(task => $task);
    $task->ack; # the same

    $q->ack(id => $task->id);
    $q->ack(space => $task->space, id => $task->id);


Confirm completion of a task. Before marking a task as
complete, this function verifies that:

=over

=item *

the task is taken

=item *

the consumer that is confirming the task is the one which took it

=back

Consumer identity is established using a session identifier.
In other words, the task must be confirmed by the same connection
which took it. If verification fails, the function returns an error.

On success, deletes the task from the queue. Throws an exception otherwise.


=head2 requeue

    $q->requeue(task => $task);
    $task->requeue; # the same

    $q->requeue(id => $task->id);
    $q->requeue(id => $task->id, space => $task->space);

Return a task to the queue, the task is not executed.
Puts the task at the end of the queue, so that it's executed
only after all existing tasks in the queue are executed.


=head2 bury

    $q->bury(task => $task);
    $task->bury; # the same

    $q->bury(id => $task->id);
    $q->bury(id => $task->id, space => $task->space);

Mark a task as B<buried>. This special status excludes the task
from the active list, until it's dug up. This function is useful
when several attempts to execute a task lead to a failure. Buried
tasks can be monitored by the queue owner, and treated specially.

    $q->release(task => $task, delay => 10); # delay the task
    $q->release(task => $task, ttl => 3600); # append task's ttl

Return a task back to the queue: the task is not executed.
Additionally, a new time to live and re-execution delay can be provided.
